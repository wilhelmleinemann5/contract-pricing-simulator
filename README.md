# Contract Pricing Simulator

A sophisticated web-based platform for shipping and logistics pricing analysis, featuring Monte Carlo simulations, option pricing models, and demand curve analysis with market shock assessment.

## üöÄ Overview

This comprehensive pricing simulator provides three integrated analysis modules designed for shipping, logistics, and supply chain professionals to make data-driven pricing decisions under uncertainty.

### **üìä Main Simulator**
- **Monte Carlo simulation** for spot price evolution vs contract rates
- **Business-focused risk metrics** including total cost comparison and scenario outcomes
- **Cost distribution analysis** with histogram visualization showing contract vs spot savings
- **Scenario management** with save/load functionality and comparison tables
- **Volume discount modeling** and volatility-based pricing
- **Smart contract rate suggestions** for 1-month and 3-month contracts

### **üìà Option Pricing**
- **Time series option analysis** showing value evolution over 13-week periods
- **Payoff calculator** for call/put instruments with strike price optimization
- **At-the-money analysis** with business-focused tooltips and guidance
- **Strategic timing recommendations** for contract execution
- **Import scenarios** from main simulator for integrated analysis

### **üéØ Demand Analysis**
- **Market shock assessment** using supply/demand equilibrium modeling
- **Parallel shift methodology** for demand curve updates from single observations
- **Smart uncertainty calculation** proportional to shock surprise level
- **Price confidence intervals** propagating demand uncertainty to pricing estimates
- **Configurable supply curves** (flat capacity constraints or sloped cost increases)
- **Customer price sensitivity modeling** with business-friendly elasticity inputs

## üîß Key Features

### **Sophisticated Uncertainty Modeling**
- **Adaptive confidence intervals** that widen proportionally to shock severity
- **Price confidence propagation** from demand curve uncertainty to equilibrium estimates
- **Smart surprise assessment** categorizing shocks as expected, moderate, or major
- **Business-realistic uncertainty bounds** avoiding unrealistic "all possibilities" ranges

### **Business Intelligence**
- **Actionable recommendations** with implementation strategies based on analysis
- **Risk categorization** with visual indicators and strategic guidance
- **Cost-focused metrics** showing total contract vs spot costs over full periods
- **Probability-based insights** for business decision confidence

### **Professional UX**
- **Responsive design** working across desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Contextual help system** with business-focused tooltips
- **Clean navigation** between analysis modules
- **Export capabilities** for detailed results and scenario sharing

## üìã Usage Scenarios

### **Contract Negotiation**
- Analyze whether to accept a 13-week contract at $3,200 vs staying on spot market
- Understand total cost implications with confidence intervals
- Compare different contract durations and pricing structures

### **Market Shock Response**
- Rapidly assess demand curve shifts after booking surges or capacity constraints
- Calculate optimal price adjustments with uncertainty bounds
- Validate pricing strategies against observed market behavior

### **Option Strategy Planning**
- Evaluate timing for contract execution based on option value evolution
- Optimize strike prices for call/put instruments
- Integrate volatility analysis with contract timing decisions

### **Risk Management**
- Quantify pricing uncertainty with confidence intervals
- Assess scenario outcomes across different market conditions
- Plan implementation strategies based on shock surprise levels

## üõ† Technical Implementation

### **Frontend Architecture**
- **Pure JavaScript ES6** with modular class-based design
- **Chart.js integration** for sophisticated data visualization
- **CSS Grid/Flexbox** responsive layout system
- **Local storage** for scenario persistence

### **Mathematical Models**
- **Geometric Brownian Motion** for price evolution simulation
- **Power law regression** for demand curve fitting with confidence intervals
- **Analytical equilibrium solutions** for market clearing calculations
- **Monte Carlo sampling** with configurable simulation counts (1K-50K)

### **Business Logic**
- **Volume-based discounting** with relationship pricing models
- **Volatility-adjusted forecasting** using historical market patterns
- **Supply curve configuration** supporting both flat and sloped cost structures
- **Price sensitivity modeling** converting business inputs to economic elasticities

## üöÄ Getting Started

### **Local Development**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/contract-pricing-simulator.git
