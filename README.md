# Contract Pricing Simulator

This project simulates contract pricing using a Monte Carlo approach. It forecasts how spot prices may evolve over a chosen period and provides statistics to help estimate contract rates and risk metrics.

## Running Locally

Simply open **index.html** in your browser. All logic runs client-side, so no server setup is required.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

1. Push the repository to GitHub.
2. In the repository settings, enable GitHub Pages and select the `main` branch.
3. Your simulator will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository>/` after a minute or two.

## Google Analytics

The sample `index.html` includes a placeholder Google Analytics 4 snippet. Replace `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` with your ID or remove the snippet entirely if you do not want analytics.
